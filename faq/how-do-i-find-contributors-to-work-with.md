# How do I find contributors to work with?

Utopian utilizes a task request feature that allows open source project owners to announce a task that needs to be done to all interested individuals within the Utopian ecosystem. To find contributors to work with, the first port of call is to make a task request. You can also find contributors to work with by browsing Utopian's contributions and projects showcase pages, which will be available soon when Utopian gets out of beta.
