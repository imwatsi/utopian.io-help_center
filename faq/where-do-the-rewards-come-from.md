# Where do the rewards come from?

Steem's economic model allows for the creation of new tokens (or units of currency) at a predefined inflation rate of around 9.5% per year, going down by approximately 0.5% every year over the next twenty and a half years, until it reaches a 0.95% yearly inflation rate . These new tokens are distributed continuously to people performing actions deemed valuable by their communities through community voting. In the case of the Utopian community, as project owners, fellow contributors and other people with vested interests in open source software development "upvote" or "like" contributions, they have a say in how these new tokens are distributed, in direct relation to their stake in the Steem ecosystem (i.e. how much Steem Power they have). The more Steem Power they have, the more rewards they can give to contributors.

Contributors are able to redeem their rewards seven days after the post or contribution has been published.
