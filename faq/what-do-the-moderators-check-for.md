# What do the moderators check for?

Projects have different needs that create varying expectations for contributions. The different categories that contributions fall into have their own requirements and guidelines. [See the contribution guidelines](https://utopian.io/rules).

There are global aspects that most moderators will review and all contributions are checked for these. Examples include the contribution's relevance, quality, legality and usefulness.

To ensure that your contributions are acceptable, acquaint yourself with the open source project's vision and what the project owners have specified on their project's page and in task requests.

When contributions are made in response to task requests from project owners, moderators will check if the contribution sufficiently meets the requirements of the relevant task requests.
