# How do the different reward options work?

Utopian gives you two ways in which to receive your STEEM rewards.

#### 1) 50% SBD, 50% STEEM POWER (default)

This option gives you 50% of your rewards in SBD, which is a form of liquid STEEM. It can be transferred and spent immediately. You can trade it for Bitcoin or any other cryptocurrency, and ultimately exchange it for the fiat currency of your choice.

The other 50% will be in Steem Power, which is STEEM that is bound to a smart contract that lets you withdraw your STEEM in 13 weekly amounts. Steem Power has a lot of utility in the Utopian ecosystem, and [more information about its importance is available in the knowledge base](#).

#### 2) 100% STEEM POWER

This option gives you all your rewards in the form of Steem Power, which you can withdraw through a 13 week schedule by "powering down" your Steem account. [Learn more about the Steem blockchain's economic model](#).
