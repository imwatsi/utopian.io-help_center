# How can I cash out my STEEM?

Once you have some STEEM in your wallet, you can transfer it to a cryptocurrency exchange that supports STEEM. There you can exchange it for other cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin or Ethereum, which are easier to exchange for fiat (USD for example).

- [Bittrex](https://bittrex.com/Market/Index?MarketName=BTC-STEEM)
- [Binance](https://www.binance.com/trade.html?symbol=STEEM_BTC)
- [Upbit](https://upbit.com/exchange?code=CRIX.UPBIT.BTC-STEEM)
- [Poloniex](https://poloniex.com/exchange/#btc_steem)
- [GOPAX](https://www.gopax.co.kr/exchange?market=STEEM/KRW)

Or you can use [Blocktrades](https://blocktrades.us/), which is integrated into the Steemit wallet interface. Just click your STEEM balance and a dropdown menu will appear. Then click “Sell” and you'll be taken to Blocktrades.
